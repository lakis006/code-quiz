# code-quiz

The code quiz was mostly constructed using Javascript with a little JQuery sprinkled throughout the script. 

The code allows the User to start the test and be taken to 4 question pages while keeping track of the wrong/right answers and punishes the user by subtracting 5 seconds from every wrong answer

after the 30 second timed quiz is over, the user gets taken to a submit name page 

after the user submits their name, they are taken to a scores page after saving their credentials into the local storage
